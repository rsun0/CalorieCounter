This app provides a list for tracking your daily calorie intake.
List of features and explanations, in order of top to bottom of the screen:

The list:
The list of food items and their calorie amounts is shown here.
Long-press either the name or calorie amount of a food item to remove it from the list.

Total:
The total amount of calories of the food items in the list is shown here.
The text is green if the total is within 250 calories of the target amount,
yellow if the total is within 500 calories of the target amount,
and red if the total is over 500 calories away from the target amount.
The target amount can be set in "Set Target".

Add:
To add a food item to the list, enter the name of the food item in the EditText marked "Name"
and the calorie amount of the food item in "Cal.", and press the "Add" button.

Set Target:
To set the daily target calorie intake amount,
enter the desired amount in the EditText marked "Calories" and press the "Set Target" button.
The target amount determines the color of the Total text, as explained above in "Total".
By default, the target amount is 2250 calories.

Save:
To save the list and the target amount, press the "Save" button.
When you close and reopen the app later, the save files will be loaded,
and your previously saved list and target amount will be shown.
Pressing "Save" will NOT clear the list.

Clear:
To clear the list and any save files, press the "Clear" button.
The target amount will be set to the default of 2250 calories.
This will clear the save files, so if you clear and close without saving,
the list will be empty and the target amount will default to 2250 calories when the app is reopened.

Lookup:
To lookup the calorie amount of a food item, press the "Lookup" button.
This will open a WebView with a website containing a database of food items.
Enter the name of the food time that you wish to lookup in the "Food" box and press "Search".
Then, a list of food items found by the search will be shown.
Press the food item that matches your food item.
Nutrition facts for that food item will be shown, including the calorie amount in the top left of the box.
Press the back button at the bottom of the screen to return to the list.
